/* DESCRIPTION:  This program reads in T test cases and the next line contains 3 longs A B and M.
                 For the program to work B must be greater than A so if it isn't we do a swap.  We
                 can do this because A is the starting location and B is the ending location. To get the
                 number of hops we divide the ending and starting location by M.  Because it is inclusive we
                 subtract 1 from the starting location A.  We then take the difference so the formula is
                 (B/M) - ((A-1)/M).  Because of strict time constraints (1 sec per input file) we must use
                 StringBuilder to construct our output.
