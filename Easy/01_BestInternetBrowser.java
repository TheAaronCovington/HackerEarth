/*
DESCRIPTION: 
    You don't need to type 'www.' to open a website anymore.
    Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website.
    The browser predicts ALL THE VOWELS in the name of the website. (Not '.com', though. Again!)
    Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.
Now to convince users that his browser will indeed save A LOT of time for users to open a particular 
website, Little Jhool has asked you to prepare a report on the same.

Input format:
The first line contains tc, the number of test cases.
The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.

Output format:
You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in Jhool's browser, to your normal browser.

Constraints:
1 <= tc <= 100
1 <= Length of the website <= 200
